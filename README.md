## 📚 About

Have you ever watched someone try to code and they were SO SLOW? Then this extension is for them! Never click and drag windows again: use Alt+Tab! **VSCode Shortcut Buddy** is like training wheels for learning nifty VSCode shortcuts.

## 🎮 How It Works

Imagine having a friend who taps you on the shoulder and says, *"Psst! You can do that way faster!"* That's exactly what **VSCode Shortcut Buddy** does. Go to the VSCode Marketplace (`Ctrl+Shift+X`) and search for **VSCode Shortcut Buddy**. Install it to get started. Alternatively, it can be found on the [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/) by searching `VSCode Shortcut Buddy`.

1.  **Just Code**: Go about your normal coding.
2.  **Get Tips**: If you do something "the slow way" (like using the mouse too much), a friendly popup will show you the shortcut.
3.  **Level Up**: Use the shortcut next time! Once you've got it down, we'll stop bugging you about it.
4.  **How am I doing?**: Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and type: `Shortcuts Helper: View Learned Shortcuts` to see what you've learned!
5.  **Support**: Works on both **Windows** and **macOS**! Please note that Mac shortcuts were not extensively verified, and the only default shortcuts are supported.
